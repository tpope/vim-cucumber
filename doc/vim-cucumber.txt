INTRODUCTION                              *vim-cucumber*

When working with cucumber, several useful commands are defined
that let you work with feature files and step definitions seamlessly.

MAPPINGS                                  *vim-cucumber-mappings*

These mappings are available in your local buffers.

                                          *vim-cucumber_[<CTRL-d>*
                                          *vim-cucumber_]<CTRL-d>*
[<C-d>            on a step jumps to the corresponding step definition and 
]<C-d>            replaces the current buffer.

                                          *vim-cucumber_<CTRL-W>d*
                                          *vim-cucumber_<CTRL-W><CTRL-d>*
<C-W>d            on a step jumps to its definition in a new split buffer
<C-w><C-d>        and moves the cursor there.

                                          *vim-cucumber_[d*
                                          *vim-cucumber_]d*
[d                on a step jumps to its definition in a new split buffer
]d                while maintaining the current cursor position.

                                          *vim-cucumber_<CTRL-^>*
<C-^>             Return from the step definition to the feature file
                  after having used the [<C-d> mapping.
